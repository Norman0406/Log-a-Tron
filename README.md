# Log-a-Tron
Automated and easy-to-use amateur radio logging software

## Where does the name come from?
The name for this software was chosen from a selection provided by ChatGPT. The initial prompt was:
> I'm currently developing an amateur radio software. It is supposed to be an easy and simple logging software, but I may also extend it to other use cases in the future, like digital modes, radio control etc. I'm looking for a name that has some reference to the use cases, but is also supposed to be funny. Can you give me a few ideas?

In ChatGPT's own words:
> The name "Log-a-Tron" is a play on words, combining "log" (as in a radio logbook) with "-a-Tron" (as in a fictional robotic or electronic device). The "-a-Tron" suffix has been used in various fictional contexts to give a sense of advanced or futuristic technology. For example, there is a character in the Transformers toy line and animated series named Megatron, and in the Marvel Comics universe, there is a character named Iron Man who has a suit of armor called the Hulkbuster Iron Man Armor.
